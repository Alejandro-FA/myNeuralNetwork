# Simple implementation of a Neural Network for learning

The Neural Network has been implemented in a python package for convenience. The main class is `NeuralNetwork`, found in `network.py`. Inside the subpackages `Activation`, `Layer` and `Loss` there are aditional basic classes implemented. Take a look at `class2_exercise.py` for a simple usage example.

**Note**: The `tensorflow` package is used for algebraic operations only.
